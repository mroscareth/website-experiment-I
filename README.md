# Etherean Empire - Interactive Landing Page

## Project Overview
We are building an animated landing page for a project called The Ethereans. In this project we are using GSAP free plugins and javascript for the animations and a little bit of CSS for the styling and simple effects.

## Core UX/UI functionality
1. Horizontal scrollling for some sections to explain the project in a creative way.
2. A hamburger menu to navigate the website.
3. A smooth scroll to the sections when clicking on the navigation dots.

5. A text scramble animation to show the title of the page.
